\emph{Front-end developer} \hfill \emph{Remote} {\parfillskip=0pt\par}

Mutual is a fintech in the peer-to-peer lending business, where I worked mainly
in maintaining the \href{https://mutual.club/en/invest.html}{mobile app for
investors}, written with React Native and TypeScript, and later at
\href{https://scora.com.br/}{Scora}, a web app for refinancing debts, written
with React.

\medskip

\begin{tightlist}
  \item Web development with React and TypeScript, mainly Single Page Apps with
    create-react-app and static websites with Next.js.
  \item Got familiar with popular tools and libraries in the React ecosystem
    such as Storybook, Redux, react-router, @mui/material, react-hook-form,
    react-query, and more.
  \item Maintained mobile apps written in React Native, that were distributed
    with App Center and CodePush, and integrated with services for analytics
    (Facebook, AppsFlyer, Firebase), monitoring (Sentry, App Center), and cloud
    messaging (Firebase Cloud Messaging).
  \item Contributed towards a more test-oriented culture in the front-end, by
    writing integration tests with react-testing-library, Mock Service Worker
    and Cypress and talking about it in our chapters.
  \item Got experienced in contributing and reviewing code with GitLab.
  \item Built CI/CD pipelines with GitLab CI/CD and shell scripts.
  \item Increased bug resolution speed by automating source maps upload to
    Sentry in our CI/CD pipelines for our mobile and web apps.
